# AI Agents Should Take My Job and Yours, Too
 
AI aware people are doing this weird thing where they overestimate the importance of their job and underestimate their own skill
On one end, they will easily say "My job might be one of the last things that is automated" (yes marc andreessen im looking at you)
and they will also say LLMs can do things I can't do. 

My stance on this is, If an AI can take my job, maybe it should.

And I'm high agency, so instead of waiting for it take away my job

I will build it

At first it will be able to do what i can do
Eventually it will be better than me

## So what will i do?

I will relax and focus on being an artist

In a post scarcity world, the best thing one can do is enjoy life and create art
